# Advice

In his 2016 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Warren Buffett wrote:

> Over the years, I’ve often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I’ve learned a good deal about human behavior. My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&P 500 index fund. To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.
>
> I believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed that same advice when I’ve given it to them. Instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and depart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out another breed of hyper-helper called a consultant.
>
> That professional, however, faces a problem. Can you imagine an investment consultant telling clients, year after year, to keep adding to an index fund replicating the S&P 500? That would be career suicide. Large fees flow to these hyper-helpers, however, if they recommend small managerial shifts every year or so. That advice is often delivered in esoteric gibberish that explains why fashionable investment “styles” or current economic trends make the shift appropriate.

> The wealthy are accustomed to feeling that it is their lot in life to get the best food, schooling, entertainment, housing, plastic surgery, sports ticket, you name it. Their money, they feel, should buy them something superior compared to what the masses receive.
>
> In many aspects of life, indeed, wealth does command top-grade products or services. For that reason, the financial “elites” — wealthy individuals, pension funds, college endowments and the like — have great trouble meekly signing up for a financial product or service that is available as well to people investing only a few thousand dollars.

Wealthy individuals naturally find it easier to pay for expert personalized advice, which is [undoubtedly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI5p8vqdjTw) [valuable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeTsh--UEe4) to many people. But they have special access to very few investment opportunities that most people would want, if they understood the risks and likely returns. Be skeptical of exclusive offers.

Of course, people with almost any level of income and wealth can use professional financial advice. As Buffett emphasized, there are many advisors who are incentivized to sell you high-fee products which generate profits for them at the expense of their clients. So you cannot seek professional advice without understanding that some advisors are predatory or [uninformed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlpwTJJEasA). If you seek a financial advisor, I recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i8D0fPzATg&t=2253s), which reviews a list of questions you can use to assess a potential advisor.

One of the most important questions to ask is, "What are your conflicts of interest and how do you manage them?" Although some are much worse than others, _all_ advisor [compensation models](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/12-things-you-should-know-about-choosing-a-financial-adviser/) have conflicts of interest. It's a bad sign if a potential advisor can't provide a thoughtful answer to this question, or seems to think they have no possible conflicts of interest.

The most unacceptable conflicts of interest are produced by models that personally compensate your advisor for selling you particular products. [Whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgBhy8iXjpI) [life](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-whole-life-insurance/) [insurance](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/debunking-the-myths-of-whole-life-insurance/) is notorious for providing a large commission to insurance salespeople who call themselves financial advisors. Although some forms of permanent life insurance are not scams, they are suitable for very few people. Unfortunately they're marketed broadly at firms like Northwestern Mutual. Nearly everyone should buy [term life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termlife.asp) for the period when others are highly dependent on their income (e.g., a 30-year term from age 30 to 60). Life insurance is not necessary for a single person with no partner or dependents, because no one relies on their income. Nor is it appropriate for an old person who would pay extravagant premiums because their risk of death is higher — there is no need to insure their adult, self-sufficient children or their spouse who can now rely on decades of savings. A whole life insurance salesperson will try to convince you otherwise.

Some wealth management firms are funded partly through revenue sharing agreements with fund companies. The financial services firm Edward Jones [has been sued](https://www.thebalance.com/who-is-edward-jones-2466520) for failing to disclose its conflicts of interest, whereby they generate most of their profits from selling their clients particular mutual funds with high fees and loads. A [load](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-a-mutual-fund-sales-load-357948) is a sales fee paid to the broker (your "advisor") for selling you the mutual fund, and it's taken out of your investment. The mutual fund company, American Funds, shared revenue with Edward Jones that was derived from their clients, who were often unaware of all the money being made at their expense.

It is frequently recommended to ask whether an advisor is a [fiduciary](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/fiduciary), which in the US means they're obligated to act in your best interest. This is a good question to ask, but you should never feel comforted that an advisor's interests are actually aligned with yours simply because they have a fiduciary obligation.

If you're motivated enough to read a detailed guide like this, it's likely that you should seek professional services only for specific needs that require expertise, rather than broad financial planning and implementation. Special needs could include tax advice for a complex situation with a [CPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Public_Accountant), or establishment of a trust with an estate planning attorney.
