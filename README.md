# Advice

In his 2016 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Warren Buffett wrote:

> Over the years, I’ve often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I’ve learned a good deal about human behavior. My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&P 500 index fund. To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.
>
> I believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed that same advice when I’ve given it to them. Instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and depart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out another breed of hyper-helper called a consultant.
>
> That professional, however, faces a problem. Can you imagine an investment consultant telling clients, year after year, to keep adding to an index fund replicating the S&P 500? That would be career suicide. Large fees flow to these hyper-helpers, however, if they recommend small managerial shifts every year or so. That advice is often delivered in esoteric gibberish that explains why fashionable investment “styles” or current economic trends make the shift appropriate.
>
> The wealthy are accustomed to feeling that it is their lot in life to get the best food, schooling, entertainment, housing, plastic surgery, sports ticket, you name it. Their money, they feel, should buy them something superior compared to what the masses receive.
>
> In many aspects of life, indeed, wealth does command top-grade products or services. For that reason, the financial “elites” — wealthy individuals, pension funds, college endowments and the like — have great trouble meekly signing up for a financial product or service that is available as well to people investing only a few thousand dollars.

Wealthy individuals naturally find it easier to pay for expert personalized advice, which is [undoubtedly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI5p8vqdjTw) [valuable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeTsh--UEe4) to many people. But they have special access to very few investment opportunities that most people would want, if they understood the risks and likely returns. Be skeptical of exclusive offers.

Of course, people with almost any level of income and wealth can use professional financial advice. As Buffett emphasized, there are many advisors who are incentivized to sell you high-fee products which generate profits for them at the expense of their clients. So you cannot seek professional advice without understanding that some advisors are predatory or [uninformed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlpwTJJEasA). If you seek a financial advisor, I recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i8D0fPzATg&t=2253s), which reviews a list of questions you can use to assess a potential advisor.

One of the most important questions to ask is, "What are your conflicts of interest and how do you manage them?" Although some are much worse than others, _all_ advisor [compensation models](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/12-things-you-should-know-about-choosing-a-financial-adviser/) have conflicts of interest. It's a bad sign if a potential advisor can't provide a thoughtful answer to this question, or seems to think they have no possible conflicts of interest.

Unacceptable conflicts of interest are produced by models that personally compensate your advisor for selling you particular products. The large financial services firm Edward Jones [has been sued](https://www.thebalance.com/who-is-edward-jones-2466520) repeatedly for failing to disclose its conflicts of interest. In 2004, Edward Jones [settled a lawsuit](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB110356207980304862) that addressed its failure to adequately inform clients of its business model. It strongly pressured brokers to place client money in mutual funds from their preferred fund companies, most notably American Funds. In exchange for clients buying shares in these high-fee mutual funds, Edward Jones was given some of the revenue from management of their clients’ money. In addition to high expense ratios, clients often paid [loads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/load.asp): one-time sales fees charged when buying mutual fund shares. Loads as high as 5.75% were split between Edward Jones brokers and the fund companies. A top executive [resigned](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB110420523903310818) after this lawsuit, and Edward Jones paid out [even more money](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115707646863151427) in 2006 for the same reason. Edward Jones settled [another lawsuit](https://www.wsj.com/articles/edward-jones-to-pay-20-million-to-settle-sec-muncipal-bond-charges-1439474284) in 2015 for overcharging its clients for municipal bonds, and [was sued again](https://www.advisorhub.com/edward-jones-sued-shuttling-customers-fee-accounts/) in 2018 for moving clients to unsuitable accounts with higher fees without adequately disclosing the costs.

[Whole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgBhy8iXjpI) [life](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-whole-life-insurance/) [insurance](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/debunking-the-myths-of-whole-life-insurance/) is notorious for providing a large commission to insurance salespeople who [call themselves](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/what-do-advisers-think-about-doctors-2/) financial advisors. Whole life insurance is a type of permanent life insurance. Although some forms of permanent life insurance are [not scams](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/appropriate-uses-of-permanent-life-insurance/), they are suitable for very few people. Unfortunately they're marketed broadly at firms like Northwestern Mutual. Nearly everyone should buy [term life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termlife.asp) for the period when others are highly dependent on their income (e.g., a 30-year term from age 30 to 60). Life insurance is not necessary for a single person with no partner or dependents, because no one relies on their future income. Nor is it appropriate for an old person who would pay extravagant premiums because their risk of death is higher — there is no need to protect their adult, self-sufficient children or their spouse who can now rely on decades of savings.

It is frequently recommended to ask whether an advisor is a [fiduciary](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/fiduciary), which means they're obligated to act in your best interest. This is a good question to ask, but you should never feel comforted that an advisor's interests are actually aligned with yours simply because they have a fiduciary obligation.

An advisor who provides ongoing services for (say) 1% of your investable assets per year becomes extremely expensive in the long run. This plot from the [section on retirement](https://github.com/investindex/Retirement) illustrated that, even for someone with modest savings, an increase of just a single percentage point in your average returns can result in hundreds of thousands to over a million dollars more wealth by retirement. If your savings habits are greater than in the example, the dollar amounts just get bigger. Compared to an advisor who charges according to assets under management (AUM), you earn a lot of money by doing your own financial planning. Most people don't appreciate how expensive a loss of 1% per year can be.

Some people are willing to pay a great deal for financial services. They may find the prospect of doing it themselves boring, overwhelming, or not worth their time. That's up to you. But if you're motivated enough to read a detailed guide like this, it's likely that you should seek professional services only for specific needs that require expertise, rather than broad financial planning and implementation. Special needs could include tax advice with a [CPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Public_Accountant), consulting with an insurance broker to choose suitable insurance policies, or establishing a trust with an estate planning attorney.

Even if the advice is on creating an investment plan, it's best to consult someone who charges hourly, rather than an advisor who absorbs part of your assets each year. The National Association of Personal Financial Advisors ([NAPFA](https://www.napfa.org/)) is a professional association for fee-only advisors. Some of them charge fees based on AUM, and some of them charge hourly fees. To minimize conflicts of interest, members of the organization aren't permitted to make money through commissions or referral fees (for recommending another professional). Full members all have the [Certified Financial Planner (CFP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Financial_Planner) certification. NAPFA is a great starting point to search for an advisor if you choose to do so.

For someone who knows how to invest, one of the greatest benefits an advisor can offer is behavioral coaching. If they can keep you from panic selling during a crash and waiting on the sidelines while the market recovers, they've earned their fees. However, you can seek counsel elsewhere. You could agree with a friend to occasionally discuss any concerns about the markets, and to speak with one another before making any major decisions. This would act as a guardrail against making fear-based decisions on your own. It's also why I recommended writing a [mission statement](https://github.com/investindex/Psychology#f1) in the psychology section. A mission statement allows you to be reassured by your most reflective self. When you're considering selling your portfolio, you can read in your mission statement that you always knew a downturn would arrive eventually, and why you resolved not to panic sell when it happens. Importantly, speaking with a friend and writing a mission statement are free.
